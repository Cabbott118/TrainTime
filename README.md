# TrainTime

To use app, simply type in: 
  1. Train Name
  2. Train Destination
  3. Train Starting Time (HH:mm Military Time)
  4. Frequency Train leaves for your Destination

Once inputs from user are taken, background calculations occur to display Next Arrival time and Minutes Away.


Edit: decided against console logging snapshots, because it was producing entirely too many logs. During development, I used one train name and location and it was getting difficult to determine differences without putting in ridiculous start times and frequency.
